#Machine Learning Hacks
##To Run:
     python -m movieRecommendationSystem
     python -m clustering


##What each component does ?
######Movie Recommendation System
* User Based collabarative filtering
* how much will one user like a particular  movie
* Find similar movies
* Out of the people Who havent seen the movie Who will like this 

######Clustering
* Kmeans Clustering .
* Extracted Principal colors from the image .Its work in progress ,dont laugh :P


![Image]( clustering/s1.jpg "Image")

![Principal color ]( clustering/c1.png "Color Image")
![Principal color ]( clustering/c2.png "Color Image")
![Principal color ]( clustering/c3.png "Color Image")



![KMeans Cluster figure]( clustering/cluster.png "Cluster Centres Creation")
